This is a go program I write to show a list of photos. 
But I run into some issues I have not found answers. 
1. I use walk, but not sure why ImageView can't handle messages. 
2. I want to show photos automatically, I call time.Sleep but GUI can't be updated in time. 

I am appreciated for any help.
